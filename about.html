        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>In 2042 Slavic militant forces (Volk) staged a coup and gained control of the Russian Capital. Soon, VOLK declared war on all of Europe, and the West, believing Russian citizens were being subjected to experimentation. All countries and governments denied any knowledge of this information. Special Forces, being hired by NATO, were deployed to gather intel on the VOLK and rumored experiments. In their offensive, VOLK forces laid siege to the NATO stronghold of TABOR.</p>
        <br>
        <p>2044, a rogue tactical nuke crashed into the small island on the coast of Tabor. The blast decimated much of the island revealing the AdvantEDGE Research Corp’s facility which had been hidden. The mainland was also damaged with pockets of nuclear radiation, mixed with other strange chemicals, promising a gruesome fate to any who enter them. With communications damaged and being trapped inside the fallout zone, the remaining NATO forces were defeated. Intense skirmishes continue as each faction suspects the others of being responsible for the blast. With limited resources, the factions scavenge the countryside for intel and equipment to support a new mission.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Discover the origins of the missile, gain control of the AdvantEDGE facility (believed to contain advanced technology), and escape from Tabor.</p>
